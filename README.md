The game Mars Rover typically involves the player controlling a rover

on mars as was specified by the NASA headquarters on Earth, for research 
purposes. However, as the rover lands on planet MARS a huge dust storm 
strikes and as a consequence, the rover now can only view few meters in front 
of it making the mission even more difficult as there might be many 
challenges that were set by aliens to keep away humans from looting the 
resources. Nevertheless, there are supplies sent by NASA to help the rover to 
successfully accomplish the mission.
